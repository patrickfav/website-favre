# Jekyll Static Website Source for Doctor's Landing Page

[](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/patrickfav/website-dr-sel)

This is the source for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static website project for a very simple doctors landing page.

A preview of the most recent commit on master can be seen on the
[staging firebase project](https://beta.selwicka-wienerroither.com/).
The production version can be found [here](https://selwicka-wienerroither.com/).

## Build

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a Ruby CLI and used as engine for Github Pages.

### Ruby

Jekyll requires Ruby 2.6+ so you might be required to install it.

Install Ruby itself:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install ruby-full
    apt-get install nodejs

Install rbenv for easier switching of ruby versions

```bash
sudo apt install git curl libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf bison build-essential libyaml-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

and add this to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)

```
echo 'export PATH="$HOMe/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

then install the desired ruby version
```bash
rbenv install 2.6.10
rbenv global 2.6.10
ruby -v
```

Then update the gems (Ruby package manager)

    gem update

For details on how to do this on the [Linux subsystem for Windows 10 see here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).

### Bundler and Jekyll

Install the `bundler`:

    gem install bundler

you may want to set the default gem path, so you don't need `sudo`

    bundle config path vendor/bundle
    
then, in the project root folder, install all the dependencies with

    bundle install

You should be able to run jekyll now with

    bundle exec jekyll -v

### Develop

With this command a development web-server will be started on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

For more info see the [quick-start section](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

### Build Site

With the following command the website will be packaged and copied to `_site`

    bundle exec jekyll build

## Continuous Deployment

Every commit to the `master` branch will be automatically build and deployed via to the [Firebase staging](https://beta.selwicka-wienerroither.com/)
environment. (_Note_: This will NOT be build with the production flag.)

Every git tag triggers a deploy to the [Firbase Hosting](https://selwicka-wienerroither.com/) through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/patrickfav/website-dr-sel).
